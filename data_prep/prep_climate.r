# prep_climate.r — Step 1 of the data-prep pipeline.
#
# Gap-fills climate data for island municipalities that have no weather
# station / climate-grid coverage of their own, by copying the climate
# series of their nearest mainland municipality (with data) under the
# island's own geocode. Reads raw_data/climate.csv.gz and writes the
# completed table to processed_data/climate/climate.csv.gz, which is then
# consumed by data_prep/merge_dengue.r and data_prep/merge_chikungunya.r.
#
# Run before merge_dengue.r / merge_chikungunya.r.
